## Project structure 🏗️

Before starting to develop, you need to understand the project structure. This will help you to know where to put your code and how to organize it.

## Formatting 📝

To keep the code clean and readable, we use the clang-format tool. This tool will format the code according to the .clang-format file at the root of the project.

## Networking 🌐

The project uses the boost library to manage the network. The server and the client communicate with each other using the UDP protocol.
