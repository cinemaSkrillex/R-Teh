# Overview of the Entity Component System

The Entity Component System (ECS) is a design pattern that is used to manage the state of the game.

It is a way to separate the data from the logic of the game. The ECS is composed of three main elements: the entities, the components, and the systems.

## Entities

An entity is an object that represents a game object. It is a simple container that can hold components. An entity can be anything in the game, like a player, an enemy, or a bullet.

## Components

A component is a piece of data that represents a specific aspect of an entity. For example, a position component could represent the position of an entity in the game world.

## Systems

A system is a piece of logic that operates on entities that have specific components. For example, a movement system could update the position of all entities that have a position component.

## ECS Architecture

The ECS architecture is used in the project to manage the state of the game. It allows for a clean separation of concerns and makes it easier to add new features to the game.

## ECS Implementation
