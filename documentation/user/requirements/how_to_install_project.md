# How to use the project

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
#On linux
cd scripts
chmod +x requirements.sh
./requirements.sh
cd ..
#On windows
#You don't need to do anything, the dependencies are already included in the following command :
$ cmake --preset windows
```

This will add the necessary dependencies mostly for SFML, which on Linux, is not shipping the necessary libraries by default.

## Instructions

To install the vcpkg dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
#On linux
cmake --preset linux
#On windows
cmake --preset windows-static
```

To build the project, you can use the following command:

```bash
cd build
cmake .. && cmake --build .
```

This will compile everything and create the executable in the build folder.

## Alternative : Using the Release version for your OS

If you don't want to compile the project, you can use the release version for your OS. You can find the release version in the release section of the repository.
